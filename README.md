### Hello! 👋

I'm _Brandon Valentine_, but most folks in tech just call me bval. I have a giant beard, and am easily recognized by it.

I work hard to bring warmth, humor, and openness to everything I do and I seek those qualities in others.

I'm a Technical Account Manager at [Workbrew](https://workbrew.com). Becoming a full-time salesperson is a bit of a surprise to me, but evidently no surprise at all to the folks who know me well and have worked with me over the years. As Employee #9 at Workbrew, my responsibilities don't end there. I'm plugged in to our support and customer success motions as well. It's good to be back in startup mode, and I couldn't ask for a better team to do this with, nor a better opportunity than making [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) available inside companies large and small.

I still manage to write software for myself occasionally. I’m a polyglot programmer most comfortable in Ruby on Rails. I have worked for long stretches in Javascript, PHP, and Perl. I am an expert SQL developer and can write complex reporting queries comfortably and efficiently. I have done occasional smaller projects in many other platforms including C#/.NET, ObjC, and Swift. I have deep experience in UNIX systems administration and devops. I have worked with AWS extensively, and have written Puppet and Chef in multiple contexts.

I'm also a founding member of the Board of Directors at the [Nashville Software School](https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com), a 501(c)3 non-profit vocational school. I have also served as one of the initial volunteer curriculum developers, and as an occasional guest lecturer and instructor. Since 2012 I have been honored to work with the Executive Director and other board members to oversee the organization’s growth into a self-sustaining, self-funded non-profit with thousands of graduates out in the workforce. Unlike many for-profit coding bootcamps, we offer scholarships to many of our students and bet on their future — receiving no remuneration unless they successfully land a job as a software developer. Our organization has transformed the already rich pool of software developers in Nashville with an even more diverse and growing group of talent.
